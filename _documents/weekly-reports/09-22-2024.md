## Whatâ€™s not going well and why:

- We have realized that creating a database using both the non-relational and relational database would not work. The relational database we have used since this program were using Oracle, but that need a license and using a non-relational database for relational database is a bit more complicated and would need to do more work than necessary.

## Suggestions/Issues:

- Migrate our database to using only relational database. Postgres is a free relational database that can be used.
- Continue weekly meetings

## Project changes:

- Our project would now use relational database, Postgres.
